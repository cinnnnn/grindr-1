korngator
========
kornshell based scripts for feeding dzen with im and rss items.

dependencies
------------
apt-get install ksh curl xmlstarlet dzen2 imagemagick xmldiff

usage (in five easy steps)
--------------------------

    * take care of the dependencies above!
    * use ./setup or copy manually: cp korngatorrc ~/.korngatorrc
    * run nbox, so it can poll the pipe.
    * mcabber should be configured to the comments below, im messages should appear in the nbox accompanied by a sound.
    * if you run rssreader it will fetch the feeds and send any new items to nbox none of the above need any parameters on the commandline.

files
-----
* getnewitems.xsl
   extracts added rss items from a feed (used by xmldiff in rsksh)
* im_mcabber*
   can be used by mcabber by setting in ~/.mcabberrc
      set events_command = <path>im_mcabber
      set event_log_files = 1
      set event_log_dir = ~/.mcabber/event_files
   make sure, that ~/.mcabber/event_files exists:
      mkdir -p ~/.mcabber/event_files
* item2txt.xsl
   extracts title, author, pubdate info out of rss2.0 items (used in rsksh
   by xmlstar)
* nbox
   polls the notifications and displays them in a dzen widget at the bottom
   right of your screen. hover over the widget and you get a scrollable
   backlog of all previous events. comming up, klicking on events makes
   something meaningful.
* rsksh
   reads the contents of ~/.rssreader, gets each feed and emits the new
   items to nbox
* rskshrc
   basic configuration for all compontnets
* setup
   script to setup all files, directories and pipes for basic functioning.
