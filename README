usage in five easy steps
------------------------
    * take care of the dependencies above!
    * use ./setup or copy manually: cp munchrrc ~/.munchrrc
    * run nbox, so it can poll the pipe.
    * mcabber should be configured to the comments below, im messages should
      appear in the nbox accompanied by a sound.
    * if you run feedmunchr it will fetch the feeds and send any new items to
      nbox none of the above need any parameters on the commandline.

files
-----
* im_mcabber*
   can be used by mcabber by setting in ~/.mcabberrc
      set events_command = <path>im_mcabber
      set event_log_files = 1
      set event_log_dir = ~/.mcabber/event_files
   make sure, that ~/.mcabber/event_files exists:
      mkdir -p ~/.mcabber/event_files
* nbox
   polls the notifications and displays them in a dzen widget at the bottom
   right of your screen. hover over the widget and you get a scrollable backlog
   of all previous events. comming up, klicking on events makes something
   meaningful.

   reads the contents of ~/.feedmunchr, gets each feed and emits the new items
   to nbox
* rskshrc
   basic configuration for all compontents
* setup
   script to setup all files, directories and pipes for basic functioning.
